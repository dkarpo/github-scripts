# forensics
A handful of scripts I've kludged together for forensic type things.

| Script  | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| convert-prtime.py | Convert PRTime to something useable. |
| credit-card-check.py  | See if a credit card number passes a Luhn check. |
| deltadate.py | Calculate the delta between two dates and times. |
| file-frobnicator.py | Add magic header/footer bytes to files. |
| furious-gold-extract-zip-password.py | Extract the zip archive password from Furious Gold physical or partition dumps. |
| matchy-matchy.py | Show the differences between two text files (ie. hash sets). |
| mime-identify.py | Copy only files with a valid MIME type to a "clean" directory. |
| parse-json.py | Parse JSON data and pretty print it. |
| redact-files.py | Overwrite all files in a directory with a "sanitized" file (ie. for disclosure). |
| undress.py | Detect multilayer images and graphic file signatures. |
| wechat-audio-parser.py | Convert carved/extracted Wechat audio files into a playable format. |
